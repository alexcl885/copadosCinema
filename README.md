# CopadosCinema Project

This is a project created in the 2nd year of the DAM module, where I am developing a web application using `React` + `Vite` to create a website for my cinema.

In this proyect i will learn how to create components also to know how to see create state in components.

In this branch i 've realized a important change in this proyect because i change the backend of my aplication becouse now i utilized a films API and its very interesting becouse i 've had to change lot of things becouse the name of variable its not the same that i had in my aplication for this its a interesting test to practice with a real API for a real situation.
